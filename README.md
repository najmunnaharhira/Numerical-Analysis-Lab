# Numerical-Analysis-Lab
This repository contains code and materials related to the Numerical Analysis Lab, including matrix manipulation and three root-finding methods: Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, and False Position Method. You can find detailed information and code examples for each method in the respective folders.
