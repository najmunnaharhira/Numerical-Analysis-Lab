# Numerical-Analysis-Lab
This repository contains code and materials related to the Numerical Analysis Lab, including matrix manipulation and three root-finding methods: Bisection Method, Newton-Raphson Method, and False Position Method. You can find detailed information and code examples for each method in the respective folders.
# Task Details
# Task_101
Complete the following tasks of matrix manipulation:

Define two matrices A & B. The values of these matrix will be taken as input from command-line
Print the max value from matrix A
Multiply matrix A & B. Handle the case where multiplication can not be possible(print proper message/resulten matrix).
# Task_102
Implement root finding Bisection method.

Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.
# Task_103
Implement root finding False-position method.

Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved
# Task_104
Implement root finding Newton-raphson method.

Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.
Bonus(+5): Draw the tangent/slope line you found at each iteration.
